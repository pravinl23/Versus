## üì° API Endpoints

### Debate Management
```http
POST /api/debate/start
GET /api/debate/{debate_id}/state
POST /api/debate/{debate_id}/argument
POST /api/debate/{debate_id}/advance
POST /api/debate/{debate_id}/judge
DELETE /api/debate/{debate_id}
```

### Voice Synthesis
```http
POST /api/debate/{debate_id}/tts
```

### Real-Time Updates
```http
WebSocket: /api/debate/ws/{debate_id}
```

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Synthesis

### Vapi Integration
The system uses Vapi's advanced neural TTS for high-quality voice synthesis:

```python
async def synthesize_speech(self, text: str, player: str) -> Optional[str]:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "https://api.vapi.ai/tts/synthesize",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {vapi_key}"},
            json={
                "text": text,
                "voice": voice_settings["voice_id"],
                "speed": voice_settings["speed"],
                "format": "mp3"
            }
        )
        return response.json().get("audio_url")
```

### Fallback System
If Vapi is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to browser TTS:

```javascript
const speakText = (text, player) => {
    const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
    utterance.voice = player === 'player1' ? maleVoice : femaleVoice;
    speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
};
```
